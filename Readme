This project aims to predict customer churn using several machine learning classifiers and compare their performance. The dataset used contains customer-related features such as account balance, credit score, and demographic details. Seven machine learning classifiers are implemented to identify whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay.

Data Processing
Data Preprocessing: Missing data handling, feature scaling using StandardScaler, and categorical data transformation with One-Hot Encoding.
Machine Learning Models:
