This project aims to predict customer churn using several machine learning classifiers and compare their performance. The dataset used contains customer-related features such as account balance, credit score, and demographic details. Seven machine learning classifiers are implemented to identify whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay.

Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machine
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
Model Evaluation: Evaluated performance using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC AUC Score
Confusion Matrix
Visualization: Generated visualizations for each model, including ROC and Precision-Recall curves.

Performance Metrics:
Logistic Regression: Accuracy: 81%; K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy: 83%; Random Forest: Accuracy: 86%; XGBoost: Accuracy: 86%; Neural Network: Accuracy: 85%
